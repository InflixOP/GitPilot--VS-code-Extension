# GitPilot - AI Git Assistant for VS Code

GitPilot is an intelligent AI-powered Git assistant that bridges the gap between natural language and Git commands directly in Visual Studio Code. Simply describe what you want to do with Git in plain English, and GitPilot will generate and execute the appropriate Git commands for you.

## üåü Features

### üß† AI-Powered Command Generation
- **Natural Language Processing**: Convert plain English requests into precise Git commands
- **Context-Aware Intelligence**: Analyzes your repository state to provide relevant suggestions
- **Multi-Model Support**: Choose from multiple AI providers:
  - **Google Gemini**: Fast, accurate responses
  - **Groq**: Lightning-fast inference with Llama models
  - **DeepSeek**: Advanced reasoning capabilities

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety & Security
- **Destructive Operation Detection**: Identifies potentially dangerous commands and requires confirmation
- **Command Validation**: Prevents command injection and validates Git syntax
- **Preview Mode**: See what commands will be executed before running them
- **Context Warnings**: Alerts about uncommitted changes, remote status, and other potential issues

### üìä Repository Analysis
- **Real-time Status**: Shows current branch, staged/unstaged files, and repository state
- **Integrated UI**: Beautiful panel integrated into VS Code's interface
- **Command History**: Track previously executed commands
